What's more solarpunk than imagining a hopeful future, choosing a hero, and creating an amazing story around them. 

[Starforged](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged) is a TTRPG system that is designed to get you in the action fast, in a world you want to explore.

Here is what the screenwriter Daniel Abraham, author of the Expanse series, has to say about it:

<blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ndglohgidzmlo5vbjt5breli/app.bsky.feed.post/3kredqbgj2c2c" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigtpxdtlc7s3fvd4l72uxbvzje2cqslaqxqvijlujlkr627ttdlpu"><p lang="en">I was really impressed by Ironsworn.  We only did a couple sessions, but the play generated some of the most memorable gaming story Iâ€™ve done.</p>&mdash; Daniel Abraham (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ndglohgidzmlo5vbjt5breli?ref_src=embed">@abraham.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ndglohgidzmlo5vbjt5breli/post/3kredqbgj2c2c?ref_src=embed">Apr 30, 2024 at 9:57 AM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Yes, he said Ironsworn, but that is the same system.

If you are looking to play it, there is an amazing app called [stargazer](https://github.com/nboughton/stargazer) that helps you manage the game, and create a journal.

I like it, so I made the app work on e-ink, and put that version here [https://ra.mage.rocks/stargazer/](https://ra.mage.rocks/stargazer/)

I have a secret project with the app that I hope to reveal in the near future. Stay tuned...
