What is Solarpunk?

Solarpunk is a genre of design, art, and speculative fiction that envisions a near-future where human society has transitioned to renewable energy and sustainable living practices. 
It's characterized by an aesthetic that combines elements of nature, technology, and community in harmonious and functional ways.
The movement promotes the idea of a positive and hopeful future, contrasting with dystopian visions often found in science fiction. 
Solarpunk stories and designs frequently explore themes of environmental stewardship, social justice, cultural diversity, and technological innovation, all aimed at creating a sustainable and equitable world. 
It's both an artistic expression and a blueprint for real-world change.
